Functions
=========
#####When math attacks, FIGHT BACK! (with fire when possible, otherwise code helps)

This app is a basic example of useing JavaScript functions to do basic math
equations.

It demonstrates:
* Creating user defined functions
* Calling functions from other functions (funception)
* Illustrates function scope and avoiding naming collisions
* Useing random numbers to simulate rolling a die
* Simulate rolling two die and counting number of pairs rolled
* Returning primitive data types from functions
